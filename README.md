# Operation Beat Me ChessAI
## Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a reinforcement learning chess engine capable of beating my friends and myself. This is will made in collaboration of Keith Gordan and myself. The readme will catalog the progess and directly we take to achieve this result. We will explore different models such as Q learning, DQN, DDQN, Imitation learning, and many others.

## Our goal
Our goal is simple, by combining our passion of low tier chess with our desire to learn more about applied machine learning. We aim to develop a mediocre Chess engine while simutaneously learning many new applicable skills for our future.

# The Project
## The chess board:
The first thing for this project will be devleoping a Chess board that has the key gym functions for reinforcement learning and a GUI for us to interact with the enviroement.
